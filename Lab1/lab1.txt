2. Note: the following points will cover in the lab (ask your lab assistant):
	1. Moving from .C to .CPP compiler:
	2. Flexible Deceleration of variables anywhere in the program.
	3. Eliminating "void" keyword from brackets in function headers.
	4. cin>> and cout<< streams.
	5. Dynamic allocation with "new" and "delete" operators.
3. Implement Swap function:
	1. Once call by value.
	2. Once call by Address
	3. And call by Reference
